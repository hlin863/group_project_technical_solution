Methodology
We decided to use Python programming language with the NumPy and matplotlib libraries. Python is a common program language with plenty of prior research. Its suitable at visualizing data.
In the project, we aim to create different simulations:
	A simulation for the infected, susceptible, and recovered groups.
	Perform logistic fitting on the cumulative infected population.
	Measure the error from the sample simulation.
	Introduce random noise to the simulation in order to add the external factors into consideration. 
The simulations will use the SIR Model: splitting the population into 3 groups (the susceptible, infected, and recovered). There are 2 transitions in the model: a susceptible individual becoming infected and an infected individual recovering. 
The simulation shows how the different population groups change over time. Initially, there were an exponential increase in the number of cases. The infected population changes reflect an epidemic wave: the infected population will reach its maximum; the epidemic reaches its peak. As the infected population grows, the recovery rate increases, and more people will recover than infected so the infected population will decrease and eventually the epidemic will end.

Pseudocode
A simulation for the infected, susceptible, and recovered groups.
The simulation is a CTMC SIR Model with the initial parameters:
	\beta, and \gamma constants: infection and recovery constant
	Initial sample population: 1000
	Simulation time: 30 days
Pseudocode
	Initialized the different population groups: the infected, susceptible, and recovered groups. Initially 10 people are simulated as infected, the rest of the population are susceptible to the epidemic, and 0 recovered individuals.
	While there are infected patients, and the time is within the limit
	Calculate the infection constant a and b
	The infection constants are used to calculate whether a patient has recovered or whether there are newly infected individuals. 
	If the randomly generated probability is less than a value, then simulate a new infection otherwise simulate a new recovery
	Update time through the formula: t\left[j+1\right]=t\left[j\right]-\frac{ln\left(u_2\right)}{a\ +\ b}
	Plot the times with the infected population
 
A simulation to generate prediction curve alongside the simulation data.
An additional logistic fitting function is applied to fit the simulated data using the formula:
result\ =\frac{a}{1\ +\ b\ \times\ e^{-c\ \times\ t}}
The logistic fit function is applied on the infected data to help with the prediction of the future infection cases, the simulation data can be helpful at giving an insight for the prediction of the future real-life outbreaks. 
A simulation to apply fitting to different dates.
The simulation considers different dates as stages in the pandemic. Using each date to simulate the projections after the date helps to give us better insights about the pandemic data at each stage in the pandemic. It is also easier to record the data in this way because it is a more realistic method of simulation: data is collected at specific time intervals ‚Äì in real-life, it‚Äôs not possible to continuously update the data. This data collection is more realistic at simulating the pandemic cases. 

	Last day of the simulation, projection:
	Average it over 100 simulations. 
	Produce a figure for the simulation
A simulation to calculate the average error for measuring the infected patients.
	A simulation generates the synthetic data to model the real-life data.
	Logistic fit is performed every 3 days on the synthetic data to generate simulated data.
	Compare the last day data of the simulated data with the synthetic data (real-life) to calculate the error in the measurement of the infected patients. The last day is considered because the data is cumulative, so the previous patients are considered. 
	The errors are initially stored in a list where the error is the absolute difference between the synthetic data and the predicted data. 
	
Limitations
The current SIR model isn‚Äôt completely accurate at projecting the different population groups. The model is simple at identifying main population groups and encapsulating the processes down to 4 simple processes: infection, recovery, exposure, and removal.  The simplification generalizes the spreading of COVID in 4 variables which meant that it will not be possible to consider each individual factor e.g., the differences between the rural and the urban environment.

Another approach to plot the curve involves using the fitting curve from the start to the end of simulation. The simulation splits the data into different stages, each stage acts as a check point to simulate the data after. At the point, the future projection is applied to simulate the current unknown data and projection is compared with the simulated data to determine the error in the curves.

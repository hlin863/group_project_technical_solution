# group_project_technical_solution
This program has different epidemic models: 
1. simulating the SIR model
2. using projection for the different models
3. compare the extrapolation with the simulated data. 
4. Calculate the error in the total number of infections registered throughout the pandemic.

Provide a documented background knowledge, technical solution, outcome evaluation and present the documentation in a report format.
